<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 6, 2026</p>

<h2>1. Agreement</h2>
<p>By accessing or using TenantSync ("the Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the Service. The Service is operated by Joe Green ("we", "us", "our"), based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.</p>

<h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
<p>TenantSync provides tools to migrate Microsoft Power Platform solutions (including cloud flows, Dataverse tables, connection references, and environment variables) between Microsoft 365 tenants. The Service includes PowerShell-based migration tools, a cloud hub for package transfer, and a management dashboard.</p>

<h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be at least 18 years old and have the authority to bind your organization to these terms. You must have legitimate administrative access to the Microsoft 365 tenants involved in any migration.</p>

<h2>4. Your Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You are responsible for ensuring you have proper authorization to migrate solutions between tenants.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your API keys and account credentials.</li>
    <li>You must comply with all applicable Microsoft licensing terms and conditions.</li>
    <li>You must not use the Service to migrate solutions containing malware, unauthorized code, or content that violates any law.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for backing up your data before initiating any migration.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>TenantSync and its underlying technology, including but not limited to scripts, APIs, algorithms, and documentation, are the intellectual property of Joe Green. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Service for its intended purpose during your subscription period.</p>
<p>Your flows, solutions, and business data remain your intellectual property. We claim no ownership over content you migrate using the Service.</p>

<h2>6. Service Tiers and Payment</h2>
<p>The Service is offered in multiple tiers with varying capabilities. Pricing is published on our website and may be updated with 30 days' notice to existing subscribers. Payments are processed through Stripe. All fees are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.</p>

<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We are not liable for any data loss, corruption, or unintended changes resulting from migrations.</li>
    <li>We are not liable for service interruptions, delays, or failures beyond our reasonable control.</li>
    <li>We are not liable for any issues arising from Microsoft platform changes, API deprecations, or licensing changes.</li>
    <li>Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid for the Service in the 12 months preceding the claim.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your use of the Service, your violation of these terms, or your violation of any third-party rights (including Microsoft's terms of service).</p>

<h2>9. Data Handling</h2>
<p>Solution packages are transferred through our secure cloud hub using HTTPS encryption. Packages are processed in transit and are not permanently stored after migration completes unless you enable hub storage. See our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for full data handling details.</p>

<h2>10. Termination</h2>
<p>Either party may terminate the agreement at any time. Upon termination, your access to the Service will be revoked. We may retain certain data as required by law or as described in our Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms or engage in abusive behavior.</p>

<h2>11. Modifications</h2>
<p>We may update these terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via email to registered users at least 30 days before taking effect. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

<h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These terms are governed by the laws of the Province of Alberta and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Alberta, Canada.</p>
